O4: Twitterbot
By Cian Ruane

To use:
 - In a console window navigate to the directory containing twitterbot.py
 - Type "python twitterbot.py bibletweets.txt"
 - NOTE: bibletweets.txt can be replaced with the path to any corpus

 - A Markov chain will be built
 - You will have the option to press enter to generate a sentence or 'q' to quit

NOTES:
 - Any corpus can be used as long as it contains only sentences and each sentence finishes with a '.', '!' or '?' character
 - The corpus provided is a mix of 31102 tweets and the 31102 lines of the King James bible. It can sometimes produce interesting results.
 - Tweets sourced from Go, A., Bhayani, R., Huang, L.: Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision. CS224N Project Report, Stanford (2009)
